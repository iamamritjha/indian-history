                <p><i><b>Date :</b> <p>October 1947 – December 1948</p>
                <p><b>Reason :</b> The Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-1948 was caused by the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir's decision to accede to India, which led to an invasion by Pakistani tribal militias and later regular forces. The Maharaja of Kashmir's request for military assistance from India, in exchange for accession, escalated the conflict. The war resulted in a stalemate and the establishment of the Line of Control (LoC) under UN mediation.</p> 
                <p><b>Outcome :</b> The Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-1948 resulted in the establishment of the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir, dividing the region between Indian and Pakistani control. A UN-mediated ceasefire ended active hostilities. The conflict set the stage for future disputes over Kashmir between the two countries.</p>

                <p><i><b>Date :</b> <p> April 1965 – September 1965</p>
                    <p><b>Reason :</b> The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was primarily caused by territorial disputes over Kashmir, with tensions escalating due to Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which aimed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to incite insurgency against Indian rule. Clashes and military engagements along the border ultimately led to full-scale war.</p> 
                    <p><b>Outcome :</b> The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 ended in a stalemate with no significant territorial changes. A UN-mandated ceasefire was brokered, leading to the Tashkent Agreement in January 1966. Both nations agreed to withdraw to pre-war positions.</p>

                <p><i><b>Date :</b> <p> December 3, 1971 – December 16, 1971</p>
                    <p><b>Reason :</b> The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was primarily caused by the Bangladesh Liberation War, where East Pakistan sought independence from West Pakistan. Widespread atrocities by the Pakistani military in East Pakistan led to a massive refugee crisis in India, prompting India to intervene. The conflict resulted in the creation of Bangladesh as an independent nation.</p> 
                    <p><b>Outcome :</b> The war resulted in the independence of East Pakistan, which became the sovereign nation of Bangladesh. India achieved a significant military victory, capturing over 90,000 Pakistani soldiers as prisoners of war. The conflict significantly altered South Asian geopolitics, leading to a power balance shift in favor of India and a long-term impact on Indo-Pakistani relations.</p>

                <p><i><b>Date :</b> <p> October 20, 1962 – November 21, 1962</p>
                    <p><b>Reason :</b> The Sino-Indian War of 1962 was primarily caused by border disputes between India and China over the Aksai Chin region in the western sector and Arunachal Pradesh (referred to by China as South Tibet) in the eastern sector. Tensions escalated due to differing perceptions of the border, India's forward policy of establishing outposts, and China's construction of a road through Aksai Chin. The conflict led to a brief but intense war with China emerging victorious.</p> 
                    <p><b>Outcome :</b> India suffered a defeat, losing control of the Aksai Chin region to China. The conflict led India to re-evaluate and strengthen its defense policies and military infrastructure. The war strained Sino-Indian relations, leading to a prolonged period of mistrust and border tensions between the two nations.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p><i><b>Date :</b> <p> May 1999 – July 1999</p>
                    <p><b>Reason :</b> The Kargil War of 1999 was caused by the infiltration of Pakistani soldiers and militants into Indian territory in the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir. They aimed to sever the link between Ladakh and the Kashmir Valley and force India to negotiate a resolution on Kashmir. The conflict escalated when India discovered the incursions and launched military operations to reclaim the occupied territories.</p> 
                    <p><b>Outcome :</b> The Kargil War of 1999 resulted in India's successful recapture of the majority of infiltrated territories in the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan faced significant international criticism and diplomatic pressure. The conflict ended with a return to the status quo along the Line of Control (LoC).</p>
