                Sanatan Dharma, often referred to as Hinduism, is one of the world's oldest religious traditions. The term "Sanatan Dharma" means "eternal duty" or "eternal order," emphasizing its timeless and universal nature. Its origins trace back over 4,000 years to the ancient Indus Valley Civilization and the Vedic period in India. The foundational texts of Sanatan Dharma are the Vedas, a collection of hymns, prayers, and rituals composed in Sanskrit. These texts, along with the Upanishads, epics like the Mahabharata and Ramayana, and various Puranas, provide the spiritual and philosophical framework for the religion. Sanatan Dharma encompasses a vast array of beliefs and practices. It is not a monolithic religion but a complex, pluralistic tradition with numerous deities, rituals, philosophies, and paths to spiritual realization. Key concepts include Dharma (duty/righteousness), Karma (action and its consequences), Samsara (cycle of birth and rebirth), and Moksha (liberation from the cycle of rebirth). The caste system, though much debated and critiqued, has also been a significant aspect of social organization within Hindu society historically.
                <p>Today, Sanatan Dharma is practiced by nearly a billion people, primarily in India and Nepal, but also in significant numbers worldwide, particularly in countries with large Indian diasporas like the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The practice of Hinduism varies widely, from rural village traditions to urban, cosmopolitan expressions. Temples, festivals, and rituals play a central role in communal and individual life. Modern Hinduism has seen the rise of numerous reform movements aimed at addressing social issues, including the caste system, gender inequality, and the integration of scientific and philosophical thought. Influential figures such as Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi, and contemporary spiritual leaders have contributed to the global spread and understanding of Sanatan Dharma. Yoga and meditation, rooted in Hindu tradition, have gained international popularity, furthering the reach of Hindu spiritual practices.</p>
                <p>The future of Sanatan Dharma looks promising, marked by both continuity and change. As globalization and technological advancements continue to shape the world, Hinduism is likely to further adapt and evolve. Efforts to promote inclusivity and address social justice within the framework of Dharma are expected to grow. The environmental crisis is also prompting a reevaluation of ancient teachings on the interconnectedness of all life and the stewardship of nature. In the diaspora, Hindu communities are increasingly engaged in interfaith dialogues, contributing to a broader understanding of Sanatan Dharma in a multicultural context. The digital age has allowed for greater dissemination of Hindu teachings, with online platforms providing access to spiritual discourses, rituals, and community-building opportunities. As younger generations engage with their heritage, there is a renewed interest in exploring and preserving the diverse traditions of Sanatan Dharma while integrating contemporary values and perspectives. The religion's inherent flexibility and emphasis on personal spiritual experience ensure its resilience and relevance in the modern world. In conclusion, Sanatan Dharma, with its deep historical roots, rich traditions, and dynamic adaptability, continues to be a profound and living spiritual path for millions. Its journey from ancient times to the present and into the future exemplifies a unique blend of continuity and transformation, resonating with timeless truths while embracing the challenges and opportunities of contemporary life.</p>

        <div class="dh">
            <i><ul><li>Samsara is the continuous cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Souls are reborn in various forms based on their karma.</li>
            <li>This cycle is seen as a state of suffering and impermanence, from which individuals seek liberation.
            </li></ul></i>
